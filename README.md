# spectere-omz-theme

Just a little Oh My Zsh! theme I cooked up.


## Installation

1. Configure your terminal emulator of choice to use a font with Powerline
   symbols baked in.
2. Install [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/).
3. Edit `.zshrc`.
4. Set the `ZSH_CUSTOM` variable to point to wherever you cloned this repo.
5. Restart your shell. :D
